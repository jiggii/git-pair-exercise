# Interview With Shan

How are you doing today? <br>

I am doing well. I am so glad we are partners!<br>

What are your plans for this weekend?<br>

Since I'm moving in August, I'm spending the weekend <br>
packing more stuff up, listing things to sell on FB, <br>
and starting to deep clean my place. Then on Sunday, <br>
I'm getting another tattoo!! What about you? What r ur <br>
plans this weekend?

Wowza!!! That is a big change, but so exciting. Sending all the positive vibes for selling all the things, getting your place cleaned and getting ready for your new adventure!<br>

Thats AWESOME about your new tattoo, what are you planning on getting?<br>

Thank you so much bro, I really can't wait to move and <br> your good vibes mean a lot to me. For my tattoo I'm getting <br> the first part in a series of tattoos I'm doing this summer, and the one <br> on Sunday is going to be a cupid on my stomach with my <br> face from when i was a baby on it <br>

Do you have tattoos?

That sounds so dope! Tattoo therapy is a real thing, plus its a form of self-care to add and create more beautiful art. I am excited for you!!!<br>
Yes, I have 6 tattoos, my most recent one is of my mom's last heartbeat, with a purple butterfly, and a semi-colon as a reminder to keep going.

How many tattoos do you currently have?

that's so beautiful! i love tattoos and have many that i've gotten and <br> done myself. I have 17 tattoos right now, lol. Do you want more? I like your lip piercing a lot and am thinking about getting the same one

That's a nice amount. I definitely do want more, I want to get a hand piece here in the near future, so I have been contemplating designs and placement. <br>You should totally get it, its called a "vertical Labre" it was very painful though, since it goes through the meat of your lip.<br>

How long ago was your last tattoo?

damn!! it hurts bad? lol i need to think about it, <br> 
i have my medusa and that was okay, but the vertical <br>
labret looks so cool. 

I have a hand tattoo I'm finishing and 2 knuckle tattoos, <br>
it's an interesting area to get tattooed. I know I still <br>
have to do your astrology reading, it would be cool to <br>
see what designs are recommended by your chart! My last tattoo <br>
was in May. 

When's your birthday?

It does look super cool. I got it done almost 20 years ago lol damn time is really flying by. Its painful, but most body mods are to some extent. <br> So you are on the Tattoo Train.... they can be so addiciting and theraputic. <br>

Yes, the astrology reading and chart, I was born June 10, 1985 @ 1:49pm I believe.

We need to schedule that!!!

Yes !! Let's schedule it right now lol. You free after class next Wednesday?
