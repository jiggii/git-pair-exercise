# Interview With Shan

How are you doing today? <br>

I am doing well. I am so glad we are partners!<br>

What are your plans for this weekend?<br>

Since I'm moving in August, I'm spending the weekend <br>
packing more stuff up, listing things to sell on FB, <br>
and starting to deep clean my place. Then on Sunday, <br>
I'm getting another tattoo!! What about you? What r ur <br>
plans this weekend?

Wowza!!! That is a big change, but so exciting. Sending all the positive vibes for selling all the things, getting your place cleaned and getting ready for your new adventure!<br>

Thats AWESOME about your new tattoo, what are you planning on getting?<br>

Thank you so much bro, I really can't wait to move and <br> your good vibes mean a lot to me. For my tattoo I'm getting <br> the first part in a series of tattoos I'm doing this summer, and the one <br> on Sunday is going to be a cupid on my stomach with my <br> face from when i was a baby on it <br>

Do you have tattoos?
