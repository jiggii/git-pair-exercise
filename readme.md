# Interview With Shan

How are you doing today? <br>

I am doing well. I am so glad we are partners!<br>

What are your plans for this weekend?<br>

Since I'm moving in August, I'm spending the weekend <br>
packing more stuff up, listing things to sell on FB, <br>
and starting to deep clean my place. Then on Sunday, <br>
I'm getting another tattoo!! What about you? What r ur <br>
plans this weekend?

Wowza!!! That is a big change, but so exciting. Sending all the positive vibes for selling all the things, getting your place cleaned and getting ready for your new adventure!<br>

Thats AWESOME about your new tattoo, what are you planning on getting?<br>>
